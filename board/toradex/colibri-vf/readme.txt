Build instructions

As a regular user configure and then build:

$ make colibri_vf_defconfig
$ make

This configuration will use a linux kernel and uboot from the git trees
maintained by Toradex and build a minimal root file system.

image file, rename it to ubifs.img and replace the u-boot-nand.imx uboot binary
on the SD card with the one generated by buildroot. Then follow the updation
procedure on the above article.
